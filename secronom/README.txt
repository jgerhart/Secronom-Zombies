+  FLESH ZOMBIES (expansion of flesh zombie variants for the flesh city)

-  FLESH CITY POPULATION (now densely crowded)

--> V1.6 - Focused on vast expansion of the zombie bestiary, mostly about the city and zed mutants. Monster sprites were redrawn by SomeDeadGuy and made them more pleasant to the game. <--
